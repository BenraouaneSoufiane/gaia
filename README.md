## Getting Started

First install dependencies then run the development server (also you can build a production version by running npm run build)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn install
yarn dev
# or
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
In a second terminal run the middleware server that handle the farcaster frame

```bash
node server.mjs
```
You can run them definitively using nohup or pm2 library 

## Enjoy :)
